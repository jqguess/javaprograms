# Java Programs//Other Programs


These are a few java programs from a few years back while in 
school.  One of them populates a gradebook and gives averages
for students and the other was just practice. These are here for the rare event
they are found by someone who may find them useful. 

These PHP scripts can be added to a site, one is a item calculator, the other
a simple dateform.
