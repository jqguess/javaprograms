# Java Programs//Other Programs


These are a few java programs from a few years back while in 
school.  One of them populates a gradebook and gives averages
for students. It creates two test objects which are prepopulated, and the other program was just practice.
These are here for the rare event they are found by someone who may find them useful. 

RouteAverage is a java program I wrote for personal use to measure the workload of
a route.  It takes the distance in feet walked, usually between 1.5 and 3 miles
per day, and the weight of product moved to determine the work which is
measured in foot lbs.
